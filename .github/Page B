    <p>My VGS was in Drammen. I went to a private school and was sttudying media and communication. 
        We had a lot of different cameras and equipment for our studies. It was fun having the opportunity 
        to create so much different.

    <p> I went to Hellerud VGS, and it was three years with the best principal ever. Throughout the year it was a lot of
        activities, and the food in the cantine was very good. I gained a lot of friends which I still have till this day.
        I am very grateful for my time at Hellerud.
