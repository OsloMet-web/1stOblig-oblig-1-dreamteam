    <p>My VGS was in Drammen. I went to a private school and was sttudying media and communication. 
        We had a lot of different cameras and equipment for our studies. It was fun having the opportunity 
        to create so much different.

    <p> I went to Hellerud VGS, and it was three years with the best principal ever. Throughout the year it was a lot of
        activities, and the food in the cantine was very good. I gained a lot of friends which I still have till this day.
        I am very grateful for my time at Hellerud.

    <p> I went to Fyrstikalleen videregående skole, it was one of my best three years. My first two years, i studied media and communication. 
        However, my last year i changed studies to general studies since media and communcation didn't feel like the right place to me. 
        This was one of my best desicions, i met new opportunities and became friends with many people. I am very grateful for my time at F21 Vgs!
